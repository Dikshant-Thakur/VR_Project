# Dynamic Hazard Simulation and Autonomous Response in Industrial Environments (IPLOM Oil refinery)
---
## Poject description
This project presents the design of the IPLOM oil refinery industrial area, including the simulation of the refinery with floating roof storage tanks, pipelines, and containment zones.

A dynamic system is implemented to track the movement of the floating storage tank roof during the inflow and outflow of oil. A UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) follows predefined flight paths to detect roof inclination and identify any other potential anomalous situations. It provides real-time feedback, enabling continuous adjustments to monitoring strategies during the simulation.

Additionally, the project includes the development of a UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle) that can communicate in real-time with the UAV
