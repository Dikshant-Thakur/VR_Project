% Concept Overview
\section{Concept Overview}
\begin{itemize} 
    \item \textbf{Brief Description:} "Dynamic Hazard Simulation and Autonomous Response in Industrial Environments" is a project focused on designing a realistic simulation of an industrial refinery environment. It includes dynamic hazard detection and immediate response systems using both UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) and UGVs (Unmanned Ground Vehicles), that can work in perfect synchronization, with custom developed real-time communication. The project is designed to monitor floating roof storage tanks and respond autonomously to any detected hazards or anomalies, ensuring safety and efficiency in the industrial area.

    \item \textbf{Objectives:} 
    \\
1. Create a realistic simulation environment of an industrial refinery area using Unreal Engine.
\\
2. Code and simulate the movement of the floating roof storage tanks during operation, including the necessary fluid physics for the oil inflow and outflow.
\\
3. Develop a smart UAV and UGV system capable of detecting hazards in the storage tanks, and autonomously adjust their trajectory and response.
\\
4. Enable real-time communication and coordination between UAVs and UGVs for more efficient strategies.

    \item \textbf{Key Feature:} The integration of real-time hazard detection and autonomous response, managed by UAV and UGV collaboration. This is further enhanced by the dynamic simulation of floating roof storage tanks, which adds an additional layer of realism to the system.
\end{itemize}

% Target Audience
\section{Target Audience}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Primary Users:} Industry engineers and safety managers, particularly those involved in refineries and other similar hazardous environments. 
\\
The project targets those relying on traditional, labor-intensive hazard detection methods, such as manual inspections or manually controlled UAVs. By automating hazard detection and response, we expect to demonstrate the efficiency and safety benefits of modern autonomous technologies tailored for their industry.
    \item \textbf{Secondary Users:} Students, researchers, and professional developers, interested in areas like industrial automation, robotics, or environmental safety.
